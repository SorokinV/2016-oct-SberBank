What is the order of the MA and AR components of the seasonal and remainder models? Note there will be a drift term, which accounts for linear trend in the time series.\n- Compute the forecast of icecream produciton for the next 12 months. \n- Plot the forecast and note the behavior. \n\nIn the code cell below, use the **ts**, **auto.arima**, **summary**, **forecast**, and **plot** functions to create the new model, print the summaries and make the plots. **Hint** use the time series of icecream production as the first argument to the **auto.arima** function. You can copy and paste the other arguments from the milk production model, but set **max.p = 1** to prevent having an over-parameterized model. \n\n****\n", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {"collapsed": true}}, {"execution_count": null, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "outputs": [], "metadata": {"collapsed": false}}, {"source": "## Summary\n\nIn this lab you have learned to work with and analyze time series data. Specifically, you have done the following:\n\n- Examined the properties of time series objects.\n- Plotted time series data.\n- Decomposed time series data into its trend, seasonal, and remainder components.\n- Modeled the remainder components as AR, MA, ARMA and ARIMA models. \n- Created and evaluated difference series methods.\n- Constructed and evaluated a forecasting model.
